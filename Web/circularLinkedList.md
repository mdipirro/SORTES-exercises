# Circular Linked List

This exercise is taken from [here](http://www.worldbestlearningcenter.com/index_files/c-tutorial-circularly-linkedlist-exercise.htm).

Create a circularly linked list in C programming language by using C structure. The circularly linked list is much similar to the singly linked list, except that in the circularly linked list, the last item of the list points to the first item of the list. By allowing the last item points to the first item of the list, the all items of the list are linked together circularly.

The program provides a menu to manage the list:

1. Add a new item
2. Delete an item
3. Find min item
4. Find max item
5. Find item
6. Print all items
7. Exit
