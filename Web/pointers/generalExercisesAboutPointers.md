# Finding max

This exercise is taken from [here](http://www.worldbestlearningcenter.com/index_files/c-pointer-max-exercise.htm).

Write a C program to find the max of an integral data set. The program will ask the user to input the number of data values in the set and each value. Then your program will show the max of the data set. Your C program will use a function that accepts the array of data values and its size. The return from the function is the pointer that points to the max value.

# Printing values

This exercise is taken from [here](http://www.worldbestlearningcenter.com/index_files/c-pointers-exercises.htm).

## Part 1

Write a C program to accept five integer values from keyboard. The five values will be stored in an array using a pointer. Then print the elements of the array on the screen. 

## Part 2

Modify the solution of part 1 in order to print the elements of the array in reverse order using a pointer.

# Sorting

This exercise is taken from [here](http://www.worldbestlearningcenter.com/index_files/c-pointers-next-exercises.htm).

## Part 1

Write a C function to sort an array of ten integer values in ascending order. The function will accept two arguments-- a pointer that points to the array and the array size. The function returns a pointer that points to the sorted array.

## Part 2

Modify the solution of part 1 in order to sort the array in descending order.
