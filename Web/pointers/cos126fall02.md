# COS 126 - Fall 02

The following exercises are taken from [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall02/cos126/exercises/pointers-array.html)

## Exercise 1
`x = {0, 4, 2, 3, 1}`

## Exercise 2
`x = {0, 4, 2, 3, 1}`

## Exercise 3
1. 0 1 2
2. 2 3 4
3. 4 Something depending on the current memory state

## Exercise 4
Because it would be much more expensive and the compiler does not know the actual array's size.

## Exercise 5
There is no difference between the functions `middle1` and `middle2`. In fact, `int *` is the same as `int[]`.
